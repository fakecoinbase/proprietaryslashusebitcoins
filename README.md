# usebitcoins: Payment Processing With Bitcoin

WORK IN PROGRESS. DO NOT TRY RUNNING THIS IN PRODUCTION. I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU LOSING MONEY.

usebitcoins lets you collect payments in Bitcoin. usebitcoins exposes
a server and an API to automate every step of receiving Bitcoin
payments. It is intended for developers to integrate Bitcoin payments
into an e-commerce site, donations page, or whatever you want that
accepts payments really. Think of it like Stripe for Bitcoin and it's
fully open source and hosted by you.
